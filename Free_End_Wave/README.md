FREE END WAVE -> GAUSSIAN PLUCK:

 This program simulates a Gaussian profile wave through a string with free ends. The string is 0.5 m in length, the speed of propagation of the wave, c, is 300 m/s, delta(x) is 0.01 m and delta(t) = delta(x)/ c. 

 The gaussian pluck wave profile if initialized in initialize.cpp. The next iteration of the wave is calculated and stored to the freeEndWace.txt file in calculate.cpp. 

 The plots.gp file is a GnuPlot script that can be run using GnuPlot from the terminal. The scipt creates a gif of the wave and is saved as freeEndWave.gif
